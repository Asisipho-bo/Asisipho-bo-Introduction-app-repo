            <p><h4 id="bio">I am Asisipho Boniwe Msitho, I am currently part of the Zaio.io practical job training program.
                I am originally from <strong>eMqanduli in the Eastern Cape</strong> and I stay in Khayelitsha,
                I have <strong>Bachelor's degree in Psychology</strong> from the University of Cape Town.
                I graduated last year and worked as an Education program assistant/researcher for the Stellenbosch
                Triennale. It was during this time that I explored and looked into other things that interest me.
                I am a <i></i>lover of the arts</i>, I write <i>poetry</i>, short <i>stories</i> 
                and <i>plays</i> and I spent some performing while I was still in University. 
                I believe we learn until the day we die and because of this I will never pass up
                 an opportunity to learn, I will always strive to be more, to be better and to stay willing.
